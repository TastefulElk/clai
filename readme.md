# CLAI

CLAI is a command line utility that'll generate, and optionally, execute
CLI commands for you based on your input.

## Installation

````bash
```sh
go install github.com/tastefulelk/clai
````

## Requirements

You need an OpenAI API key, which can be obtained for free by following the instructions [here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart/step-2-setup-your-api-key).

## Usage

First, you need to set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable:

```bash
export CLAI_OPENAI_KEY=your-key
```

Then run clai:

```bash
$ clai -q "Find all rows in log.txt that contains the words 'error' or 'warn'"
Here's the suggested command(s) to run:
grep -Ei 'error|warn' log.txt
Do you want to run it directly? y/N
```

### Options

- `-m|--model`: Specify the model to use. (Default `gpt-4o`)
- `-h|--help`: Show help message.
- `-v|--verbose`: Show verbose output.
- `-t|--api-token`: Specify OpenAI API token. This will take priority over the `CLAI_OPENAI_KEY` environment variable.
- `--version`: Show clai version
